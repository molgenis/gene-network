                    <p>
                        GADO (GeneNetwork Assisted Diagnostic Optimization) is a method that can predict phenotypic
                        consequences of genes when mutated, using public RNA-seq data of 31,499 samples. Using the
                        phenotypes of a patient denoted as Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms we can prioritize genes
                        harbouring candidate mutations. This saves time interpreting identified variants and aids in
                        the discovery of new disease-causing genes.

                        We have created a standalone version of GADO that can easily be integrated in an automated analysis pipeline.

                    <p>
                        MetaBrain Network uses gene co-regulation to predict pathway membership and HPO term associations.
                        This is done by integrating over 8000 (semi) public RNA-seq samples from brain.

                    <p>
                        We do not have significant predictions for all HPO terms. Either because very few genes are
                        known for a term, or because our current dataset is unable to reliable predict back the known
                        genes for a term. In these cases, we suggest using the more generic parent terms.

                    <p>
                        At the moment we don’t support searching using the synonym names of HPO terms, this will be
                        resolved in a future version. Try searching by the HPO number

                    <p>
                        Gene expression patterns are not informative for all genes. If an expected gene is not found
                        back this is the most likely explanation.

                    <p>
                        The gene predictability score is an indicator on how informative gene expression is in
                        predicting gene functions. For details please see: <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/25/375766" target="_blank">Improving the diagnostic yield of exome-sequencing, by predicting gene-phenotype
