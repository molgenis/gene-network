install the dependencies by running from the root directoy of the project:
'npm install'
build the project by running from the root directory of the project
'npm build' or if you want the page to be refreshed when you make changes to the code 'npm build:watch'
if you are running in debug mode, in assets/views/homepage.ejs, change the reference to 'reactbunle.min.js' to 'reactbundle.js'

if you wish to work on the backend, instead of using the remote genenetwork backend, go into domain.js and change the domain to
''
this may change some behaviour, for example the max size of a GET request is probably larger on the remote server than on your localhost

start up the redis server:
'redis-server' or 'brew services start redis' or any other way you may have installed it

start the application by running from the root directory:
'npm start'
you should now be able to see the page at localhost:1337 in your browser

'npm i natives'
then redo the build and run
